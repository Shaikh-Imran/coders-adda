=============
Developer's Tea Point.
--------
Welcome to **Adda** (Meeting point) guys, Thanks for joining me! 

Here I will be writing some tips and tricks as well as some small tutorials,
based on what I have used during my work as a Software Developer. 

It will be more focused on Java and Java based frameworks like Spring and Hibernate at first,
And I will be adding more languages such as JavaScript, Scala and others.

---
**Note** : Just bring a cup of tea and let the fun begins.
